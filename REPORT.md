## Phase 2
We decided to use a struct to hold individual commands (as hinted to by the assignment description), and decided to store the parsed command in an array of `char**`. We decided to store the actual command e.g. echo, cat, etc. in a `char*` variable called prefix, so that it would be easy to pass into `execvp()`. Initially, we used `strtok()` to parse the command into individual words, but we changed to reading input character by character on the advice of [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/k52pjbhb7ku3ws?cid=42). To parse the input, we grouped any character that could represent the end of an individual argument i.e. a space, a meta character, or the null character at the end of a `char*`.

## Phase 3
Implementing the built-in functions `pwd, cd` and `exit` required a simple read-through of this [link](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Working-Directory) provided in the assignment description, and then the correct usage of the `chdir()` and `getcwd()` functions. We implemented the built-in functions in `main()`, and called the function `executeCommand()` on any other command.

## Phase 4
To implement output redirection, we added a boolean in our Command struct that told us whether or not this command required output redirection. If our boolean was true and we reached the end of the input line, we know that the last word we parsed was the name of the file, which we stored as part of the command. Following the lecture slides, we used `dup2()` to complete the redirection.

## Phase 5
Implementing piping required a large-scale rearranging of our code, as we decided to use `strtok()` with the pipe as a delimiter in `main()` to break the input into individual commands, which we then passed into our `parseCommand()` function and stored into an array of Commands. We used [this site](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-demonstrate-fork-and-pipe/?fbclid=IwAR2Wkq-tbUO9zuL1IfI7uZsg82a_1XYxbKClhDMVxeBXVOM-UrVcGvQ8h40) to understand how the `pipe()` function worked with forking, [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30899706/how-to-write-read-multiple-times-to-a-pipe?fbclid=IwAR1qjVH_aAfHm29WzLut9sINT2uvgHJVtCL2LCcCuG70EMj_1bJa24QIz1E) to deal with piping more than once, and the man page for piping. The initial plan was to create a `pipeline()` function similar to what was presented in the lecture slides and call it on any two commands that needed piping, but due to time constraints and many errors, we hard-coded the neccessary forks and `dup2()` calls for a maximum of 3 pipes.

## Phase 6
For the directory stack, we took the advice of Professor Porquet and used a single linked list. I found my notes from Dr. Frid's ECS36C class, where we wrote psuedocode for the implementation of a linked list, and created a struct Node to represent an entry in the list. Since we were implementing a stack, our method to add nodes to the list was pre-pending, and we used the built-in `cd` function for changing directories after pushing or popping.
